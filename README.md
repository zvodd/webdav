## Install

Please refer to the [Releases page](https://github.com/hacdias/webdav/releases) for more information. There, you can either download the binaries or find the Docker commands to install WebDAV.

## Usage

```webdav``` command line interface is really easy to use so you can easily create a WebDAV server for your own user. By default, it runs on a random free port and supports JSON, YAML and TOML configuration. An example of a YAML configuration with the default configurations:

```yaml
# Server related settings
address: 0.0.0.0
port: 0
auth: true
prefix: /

users:
  - username: user
    password: password
    scope: .

```

There are more ways to customize how you run WebDAV through flags and environment variables. Please run `webdav --help` for more information on that.
